# DiceThrower
My Dice rolling program I originally made as a Java MVC and Swing framework exercise(not the most pure mvc-example since you can't achieve it with Swing).
> - You roll one dice.
> - You can enter how many times you wish to roll the dice.
> - The program shows you the amount of rolled dices.
> - The result of the rolled dice is displayed as normal text(Jlabels) and as a picture of the corresponding dice.
